<h1>Nexus</h1>

nex·usˈneksəs' : a connection or series of connections linking two or more things.

"It is not the concept of money – monetary value – that is the issue; it is the implementation of it."

Money is only a container of energy allowing exchange of value between two parties. Nexus applies a decentralized, mathematically regulated, transparent currency designed for stability and sustainability: Its denomination is termed Nexus, traded with the currency ticker NXS on exchanges. Decentralization is inherent to success, as centralized points only serve as fail points, as malleable targets to be exploited for the benefit of few. In order for a system to be designed in service of the people, its creation must be forged under like principals. This has been brought forth through history, in its successful implementations of self governance, of liberty, and the right to sustenance for all life. This right has been circumvented, in which, our only choice is to form a Nexus, to combine our strength as a single global race – and preserve our right to life, freedom, and the pursuit of happiness.
