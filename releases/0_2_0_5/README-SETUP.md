# About nexus-qt

This is a compiled version of the Nexus wallet for linux, nexus-qt, as of version 2.0.5.

You can run it with the command:

    ./nexus-qt &

However, if you only do this it may take a long time to sync your wallet via the peer-to-peer network.

If you're ok with this then this is all you need to do to get started.

Just remember to back up your wallet.dat file which is stored in ~/.Nexus/wallet.dat

# Setup script

There is an optional setup script which can speed up how fast your wallet syncs with the network.

You can either run this script or inspect it and replicate what it does yourself if you want your wallet to sync up faster.

If getting in sync more quickly is important to you, this is highly recommended.

Simply run ./setup-nexus-qt.sh from the command line.
